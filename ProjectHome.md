The dplay protocol is used by a number of popular win32 games.

In order to help building the dplay dlls for the Wine project, contorted aims to figure out and document the dplay protocol, both by providing text documentation of the PacketTypes and a wireshark dissector.

In addition, I am building a contorted chat client/server application that will interact with a corresponding dplay based client/server application.
